These pages should be designed to be minimalistic, focusing on functionality and ease of use, aligning with the platform's philosophy. Each page should facilitate the user's journey through the platform, with clear calls to action and intuitive navigation.


User Login:

Implement an authentication system that handles user login.
Determine if the logged-in user is a teacher or a student.
Teacher's Journey:

Redirect to a Teacher Dashboard after login.
On the dashboard, provide options to:
Create and manage courses.
View student progress.
View next lessons.
Each course management option should lead to the respective modules for creating and updating course materials and monitoring student performance.
Student's Journey:

Redirect to a Student Dashboard after login.
On the dashboard, provide options to:
View upcoming assignments.
View a learning overview.
View next lessons.
Allow students to navigate to a lesson, which includes:
Reading lesson content.
Participating in a chat during the lesson.
Generating questions for the lesson if not at the end.
At the end of the lesson, students should be prompted to take a quiz.
After the quiz, direct students to a lesson completion page.
From there, students can return to their dashboard.
Back-end Considerations:

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between teacher and student permissions.
Store user data, courses, lessons, quizzes, and results in a database.
For real-time chat, use WebSocket or a similar technology for live communication.
Front-end Considerations:

Create separate dashboards for teachers and students with user-friendly UI/UX.
Use asynchronous requests to load and submit lesson content and quiz answers without page refreshes.
Ensure the chat system is integrated into the lesson interface.
Quiz and Question Generation:

Include a quiz module with questions related to the lesson content.
Implement an algorithm or set up a database of questions to generate quiz content dynamically.
Progress Tracking:

For teachers, implement a progress tracking system to monitor and visualize student learning progress.
For students, display a summary of completed and pending lessons and assignments.
Data Security:

Ensure all data transactions are secure, particularly user authentication and quiz submissions.
